-> write a program to print the fibonacci series until the term is less than 500?    [2075 Chaitra]

-> write an algorithm, draw flowchart and program to input a number check if it is armstrong or not?    [2075 Ashwin]

->write a program in C to find out whether the nth term of the Fibonacci series is a prime number or not. Read the value of n from the user and display the result in the main function.
